Howdy, y'all! I'm AJ, a Junior Back-End Engineer. 

I am a current student at the Turing School of Software and Design.

I'm looking for opportunities to work after graduating in November 2020!

Besides my school projects, I am working on:
- :art: Building personal web pages for artist entrepreneurs in my community
- :bat: Procedurally generating a Gothic Novel to submit to [NaNoGenMo 2020](https://nanogenmo.github.io/)
