# AJ Tran - @ajtran303

Howdy, y'all! I'm AJ, a Junior Back-End Engineer. 

I am a current student at the Turing School of Software and Design.

I'm looking for opportunities to work after graduating in November 2020!

Besides my school projects, I’m currently working on:
- Building personal web pages for artist entrepreneurs in my community
- Procedurally generating a Gothic Novel to submit to [NaNoGenMo 2020](https://nanogenmo.github.io/)

### How I became a software developer:

In 2016, I decided to learn a new skill set so I could change careers and stop working in restaurants. I started by learning how to alter the appearance of a web page. I spent approximately 3 years studying on my own by reading books, watching tutorial videos, and going to coding workshops. I took notes and wrote my first programs: command line utilities to procedurally generate art.

In 2019, I became a coding instructor. I taught students from grades K-6 in physical and virtual classrooms. The leadership and training skills that I honed in the food and beverages industry definitely carried over to working with young children!

In 2020, I transitioned from being a teacher to being a full-time student. I enrolled at the Turing School of Software and Design and studied Back-End Engineering. The most important thing I learned from the Turing School is how to work with other developers. That, and how to create web applications that connect to a database. :)
